what_i_learned: |
  I began working with sample EEG data collected from the Muse headband. I explored how raw signals are structured and started plotting them using Python with matplotlib. I also read a few papers on how attention and relaxation states are inferred from brainwave frequency bands.

blockers: |
  Some of the EEG sample files had inconsistent formatting, which broke my initial parser script. I had to write a cleaner pre-processing step to normalize the data. Also, setting up the LSL (Lab Streaming Layer) environment took longer than expected.

reflection: |
  I’m starting to understand how complex biosignals are, but that makes the project even more interesting. It’s fascinating that our thoughts and muscle activity can influence a robot’s behavior. Can’t wait to start real-time classification soon!
