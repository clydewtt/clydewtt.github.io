what_i_learned: |
  Today I was introduced to the mBot Neo hardware and explored its basic capabilities. I learned how to connect the robot to the development environment and run sample programs using Makeblock's software. I also started reviewing documentation on the EEG and EMG sensors that we’ll use later in the project.

blockers: |
  I initially had trouble getting the mBot Neo to connect via Bluetooth on my laptop. After some troubleshooting and firmware updates, it finally worked. I also realized I need to brush up on serial communication protocols.

reflection: |
  It felt great to finally start working hands-on with the robot. I’m excited to see how we’ll integrate the physiological sensors, and I already have ideas for how we might visualize the signals in real time.
