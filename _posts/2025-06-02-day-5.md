what_i_learned: |
  Today I ran my first real-time test using live EEG input from the Muse headband. I learned how to stream data using the Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) and visualize it dynamically in a Python dashboard. I also experimented with filtering techniques to isolate alpha and beta wave activity.

blockers: |
  The real-time signal occasionally lagged due to inconsistent Bluetooth connectivity. I also noticed occasional noise spikes, which made it harder to interpret the data accurately without applying smoothing or notch filters.

reflection: |
  Running a live brain-computer interface, even at a basic level, was incredibly rewarding. It made the project feel tangible. I’m excited to explore how this can trigger responses in the robot soon—like simple movement based on attention states.
