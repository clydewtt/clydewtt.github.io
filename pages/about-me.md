  bio: |
    I’m currently a junior studying Electrical Engineering at Example University in Atlanta, Georgia. I expect to graduate in 2026.

    My work explores the intersection of hardware and intelligence—how wearable devices and embedded systems can help people better understand their health and environment.

    When I’m not working on research, I enjoy mentoring younger students, playing jazz trumpet, and tinkering with Raspberry Pi projects in my free time.
