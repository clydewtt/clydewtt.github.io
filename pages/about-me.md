  bio: |
    I’m currently a senior studying Computer Science at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect to graduate in 2025.

    I’m deeply passionate about building technology that empowers people. Whether I’m writing code, collaborating on research, or leading a student organization, I love turning ideas into real, useful solutions.

    Outside of tech, I’m into photography, community engagement, and exploring how creativity blends with logic in everything I do.
