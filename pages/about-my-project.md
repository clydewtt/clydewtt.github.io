subtitle: Human-Robot Interaction & Physiological Computing
project_title: "mBot Neo: Bridging Biosignals and Robotics in Education"

problem: |
  There is a lack of research exploring how to build educational software that integrates
  physical robots with physiological sensors. The goal is to investigate how biosignals
  (like EEG and EMG) can enhance student interaction and learning through responsive robotics.

approach: |
  The system will follow a three-stage process:

  - Capture physiological data such as EEG and EMG from the human body  
  - Process raw sensor data and classify events like gestures or emotional states  
  - Map classified outputs to actions or behaviors in a physical robot (e.g., mBot Neo)

  These steps aim to establish a closed-loop interaction between human signals and robotic behaviors.


outcome: |
  This project is expected to result in a conference poster presentation at the end of the DREU program.
  The poster will highlight the system's technical architecture and findings from experimental use.
